# TerminusDB

[![Build Status](https://github.com/terminusdb/terminusdb/workflows/Publish/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/terminusdb/terminusdb-server)

TerminusDB is an open source, model driven, revision controlled RDF
graph database for distributed collaboration designed for the web-age.

TerminusDB allows you to push, pull, time-travel and merge graphs,
much in the way that is possible in git.

TerminusDB Server provides TerminusDB with a RESTful API for
interacting with knowledge graphs via the JSON-LD exchange
format. This means you can easily compose applications within your own
toolchain which utilise the powerful features of graph search and
graph storage.

We use an advanced git-like model, storing append only changes to
graphs represented in succinct datastructures using
[terminusdb-store](https://github.com/terminusdb/terminusdb-store). You
can read a description of the architecture in our [Succinct Data
Structures and Delta Encoding for Modern
Databases](docs/whitepaper/terminusdb.pdf) whitepaper.

TerminusDB's *delta-encoding* approach makes possible branch, merge,
push, pull, clone, time-travel and other git-like operations on a fully
featured graph database.

## Getting Started

Desktop versions of TerminusDB can be found in our [Download Center](https://terminusdb.com/hub/download)

For development and testing we recommend our [TerminusDB Bootstrap](https://github.com/terminusdb/terminusdb-bootstrap) installer, which uses the Docker image

### Building from source

In order to build from source, follow the [build from source](docs/BUILD.md) directions.

### Command Line

In order to start the terminusdb server or simply to explore a store
from the command line, you can use the [TerminusDB Command Line
Interface](docs/CLI.md).

### Open Console

Once you have installed terminusdb-server either from the docker image or built from source you can go simply enter the server location into your browser to view your database from the console `"http://SERVER:PORT/"`. (the default is: [http://localhost:6363/](http://localhost:6363/)).

### Known Issues
On Linux, the AppImage for the desktop client may fail to start, with a message about an incorrectly configured SUID sandbox helper binary. We are looking into this issue. For now, you can work around this issue by starting the binary with the `--no-sandbox` flag.

## Why

TerminusDB will:

* Give you collaboration features currently available in git, but designed to work well with large datasets
* Make complex data models easy, maintainable and enforced.
* Overcome the Object Impedance mismatch without turning your Database into an incomprehensible soup.
* Allow you to search for repeating patterns using recursion.
* Enable the sharing of data using linked open data formats RDF and JSON-LD making scientific or organisational information sharing easy.
* Branch, clone, merge, time-travel, push and pull all facilitated by our delta-encoding approach
* Help you automate the production of UI and data-entry by *knowing* what data *means*.

## Client

In order to begin manipulating and querying your database you can
start the TerminusDB server (using the CLI) and then simply point your
browser to `"http://SERVER:PORT/"` which should allow you to manage
and query your database.

You can also perform all configuration, querying and management
functions via the RESTful API. We have a number of client libraries to
help you get started:

The [JavaScript client libraries](https://github.com/terminusdb/terminusdb-client) give you
assistance with programatic access.

The [JavaScript dashboard](https://github.com/terminusdb/terminusdb-dashboard) is an example
application allowing manipulation of the database using the javascript client fluent syntax.

The [Python client libraries](https://github.com/terminusdb/terminusdb-client-python) allow
you to use a pythonic syntax to query the database.

## Documentation

In order to use your TerminusDB through the console rather than
directly through clients you should look at the documentation on our
[TerminusDB documentation](https://terminusdb.com/documentation/) website.
